# Beijing Air Quality Analysis 🌏💨

This repository contains an analysis and visualization of Beijing's air quality data, focusing on **PM2.5 pollution levels**. The project includes both a **data analysis pipeline** and an interactive **Streamlit web app** for exploring air quality trends across multiple districts.

## 📌 Project Overview

Air pollution remains a major challenge in urban areas like **Beijing**. This project aims to analyze **air quality trends** and visualize **pollution levels** across districts using historical data.

### 🔍 Key Questions:
1. **Which district has the highest PM2.5 levels?**
2. **How do meteorological factors influence PM2.5 pollution?**
3. **Are there specific times of the day when PM2.5 levels are most dangerous?**

## 📂 Dataset

The dataset includes air quality data from three districts in Beijing:
- **Tiantan**
- **Dongsi**
- **Huairou**

Each dataset contains:
- **Pollutants**: PM2.5, PM10, SO2, NO2, CO, O3
- **Meteorological data**: Temperature, Pressure, Wind Speed, Rainfall, etc.
- **Time-based attributes**: Year, Month, Day, Hour

## 🚀 Features
